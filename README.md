## Prerequisites
- Windows SDK
- Python 3.x
- VMware and target OS
- VirtualKD
- WinDbg extension: !exploitable, pykd

## Get Started
### on host OS
1. `pip install pykd pypiwin32 winshell`
1. `python setup.py` as admin.
1. `python start_fuzzing.py` as admin.
### on target OS
1. `pip install pypiwin32 winshell`
1. `python setup.py`

## Tested On
\# | host OS | target OS
-- | --------------- | ----------------
0 | Windows 10 x64 | Windows 7 x64

## Further Improvement
- to validate and automate `IDA` ioctl script `win_driver_plugin`
- to improve fuzzer
- master/slave task management
- web interface
